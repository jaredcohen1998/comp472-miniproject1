A) F1-score is the evaluation metric we want to use since precision and recall are both important. 
Precision is important because we want to be certain about our target class predictions, and recall
is important because we want to maximize our target class predictions. The importance of precision and 
recall can vary based on the application of the NB text classifier.

B) The performance of each test varied slightly because we added a different smoothing value to the NB classification,
so word frequencies in the vocabulary varied from test to test. Recall and F1 for each class remained mostly
the same throughout the tests, but precision saw the most variation. This could be caused by low-to-zero frequency
words being given more weight, and therefore affect the number of false positives in the test set.
